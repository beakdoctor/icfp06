Here are the UM implementations that I've made.

The Java version is a translation of the one written in C#. Java
doesn't have unsigned types, so things were done slightly differently in
some cases.

The Java version is slightly faster than the C# version using Mono.

I also have version written in Common Lisp that when compiled with
SBCL is a tiny bit faster than the Java version (on my machine).
